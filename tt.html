            Error detection. Error detection occurs at both the hardware and software levels. At
        the hardware level, all data transfers must be inspected to ensure that data have not
        been corrupted in transit. All data on media must be checked to be sure they have not
        changed since they were written to the media. At the software level, media must be
        checked for data consistency; for instance, do the number of allocated and unallocated
        blocks of storage match the total number on the device. There, errors are frequently
        process-independent (for instance, the corruption of data on a disk), so there must be a
        global program (the operating system) that handles all types of errors. Also, by having
        errors processed by the operating system, processes need not contain code to catch and
        correct all the errors possible on a system.</div>
